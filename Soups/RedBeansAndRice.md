# Red Beans and Rice

## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp adobo
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 4 tbsp thyme
* 1 tbsp gumbo file 
* 4 bay leaves
* ground black pepper
* salt to taste (depends on ham/stockâ€¦.)

## Instructions
*  soak beans for 2-3 hours in water, can do overnite, but that's the mostest.
*  fry bacon til crispy
*  wilt onions and garlic(if dried, just add when add stock)  and green peppers til transparent in bacon fat, green peppers/poblanos  should be added 1/2 way through this
*  add sausages and cook
*  add the beans. stock, parsley,  and spices and bring to boil
* simmer for ~ 2 hours stirring every 30 minutes

    this thickens even better than a roux does :)
