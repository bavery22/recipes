# Crispy Roasted Chickpeas adapted from Love and Lemons

#Ingredients
* 1 can cooked chickpeas, drained very thoroughly and patted dry with paper towel
* salt
* smoked paprika

#Instructions
* 1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.
* 2. line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
* 3. Add drained chickpeas to a bowl. PAT DRY with paper towels. Remove any loose from chickpea skins.
* 4. Transfer the dried chickpeas to the baking sheet.
* 5. Spray lightly with olive oil. Toss with generous pinches of salt and smoked paprika.
* 6. Roast the chickpeas for 25 to 35 minutes until quite brown and crispy. Ovens can vary, if your chickpeas are not crispy enough, keep going until they are!
