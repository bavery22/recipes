this is vegetarian if they eat eggs LOL

4 eggs
1 tomato (like an actual sized one, not cherry tomato) diced
about a tsp each of 
soy sauce
sesame oil
sherry
mirin (optional)

beat eggs with soy sauce, sesame oil, sherry, mirin

cook omelette style in a frying pan on high heat. the high heat with oil is key for this to be fluffy.

remove from pan
fry diced tomato in pan on medium heat until soft 

add egg back in, stir and break up
add some water to the pan
cover and steam until water is gone

serve!
