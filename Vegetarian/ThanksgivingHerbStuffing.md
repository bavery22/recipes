#Very Herbaceous -- Stuffing -- Serves 8
#Ingredients
* 1 lb of sourdough
* 1.5 stick room temp butter
* 2 cups (2 ? depends on size of leek) leeks -- washed well halved thinly sliced
* 4 celery stalks (1.75 cups)
* 3 garlic cloves chopped (skip for mom)
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup fresh chopped sage (leaves only)
* 1/4 cup fresh chopped italian parsely
* 1.5 tsp fresh rosemary chopped 
* 1.5 tsp fresh thyme chopped
* 1.5-2 cups pacifica vegetable broth
* 2 large eggs beaten


#Instructions
* 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease an 8x11 or 9x13-inch baking dish.
* 2. Tear the bread into 1-inch pieces* and place in a very large bowl. if the bread isnt already stale,
     spread the torn pieces in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in a 350°F
     oven to dry them out a bit before proceeding with the recipe.
* 3. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper,
      and sauté for 5 minutes, turning the heat to low halfway through. Pour the leek mixture over the
      bread and sprinkle with the sage, parsley, rosemary, and thyme. Use your hands to toss until coated.
      Pour 1½ cups of the broth evenly over the stuffing and toss to coat. Add the eggs and toss again.
      The bread should feel pretty wet. If it’s still a bit dry, mix in the remaining ½ cup of broth.
      The amount you use will depend on how dense and dry your bread was.
* 4. Transfer the mixture to the baking dish. If making ahead, stop here, cover the dish with foil,
      and store in the refrigerator until ready to bake.
* 5. When ready to bake, drizzle the 3-4  tablespoon melted butter on top and bake, covered, for 30 minutes.
      If you start off refrigerated, this will take more like 40 min.
      You can also just use the extra 1/2 stick to dot the top instead of melting and drizzling.
      If the stuffing is still pretty wet, uncover the dish and bake for 5 to 10 more minutes to crisp the top a bit.
* 6. I like to end it with broiling it to brown the top. BE VERY CAREFUL TO WATCH IT IF YOU DO THIS SO IT DOESNT
      SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM AND BURN.
