use whatever amount of baby bok choy you want (I used like, 8 cuz that'sd how many i had)

heat oil

add a couple spoonfuls of minced garlic
and like 3-4 dried chopped chinese chilis

when fragrant and before burning add chopped and washed baby bokchoy

stir fry for a few minutes

add like a tsp of msg nad 1-2 tsps of salt

mix stir fry should fry for like 3-4 minutes overall

then eat it's sooooo good
