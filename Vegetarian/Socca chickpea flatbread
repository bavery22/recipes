# Socca adapted from Megham Splawn

# Ingredients
* 7/8 cup chickpea aka garbanzo bean flour
* 7/8 cup water
* 1 ½ tbsp olive oil
* ½ tsp salt
* ~ 1 tsp high heat oil	

#Equipment Needed
* Le Creuset 3.5 quart very shallot braiser (like at Sunriver) or 11” skillet with ceramic handle.
* It is okay if the braiser has a plastic lid handle, as the lid will not be used. 
* Very sturdy set of oven mitts.
* Kitchen fan (the one above the stove) or nearby window that can be opened.
* mixing bowl or 4 quart glass measuring cup with spout

# Optional Equipment
* whisk
* flexible spatula

* NOTE: This recipe takes at least 35 minutes to make. Note that the oven HAS to be turned on at the beginning.

# Instructions 
*  1. Prepare oven by making sure top rack is 6-9 inches from the broiler element.
*  2. Place the oven-safe heavy skillet in the oven, preferably on a middle or bottom rack.
*  3. Preheat oven to 450, then proceed immediately to the next step.
*  4. In the mixing bowl, place the chickpea flour, water, olive oil, and salt. Mix or whisk thoroughly to get rid of lumps. 
*  5. Set aside the chickpea mixture for at least 25-30 minutes to allow chickpea flour to absorb some of the water.
*  6. After 25-30 minutes, carefully remove the skillet and set on heatproof surface. 
*  7. Increase oven to broil; if there is am option to set a broil temperature, use 525 degrees.
*  8. Add ~1 tsp high heat oil until oil is dispersed throughout the bottom of the skillet. You may swirl the skillet if you want and decant excess oil; I have found this not to be necessary for yummy socca. 
*  9. Carefully pour the batter in the middle of the skillet and spiral outwards into a flat pancake, avoiding the walls of the skillet.
* 10. Put the skillet on the top rack of the oven.
* 11. Immediately turn on kitchen fan and/or open a window.
* 12. Broil for 5 to 8 minutes, checking frequently starting at 3 minutes. It should blister and start to turn brown/black at the edges. 
* 13. Skillet  may benefit from being turned if only one half starts to get brown marks/blisters on it.
* 14. Socca is done when top stop blistering and/or has scattered brown marks, and/or edges are starting to get more black.  It should still be fairly flexible in the middle.
* 15. Remove skillet to stove top. 
* 16. After a few minutes, you can turn off fan/close window. Use a flexible spatula to remove. May slice or tear to serve.
