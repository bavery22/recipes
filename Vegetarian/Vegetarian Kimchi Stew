for nonvegetarian version see under pork. This is a bastardized version of kimchi jjigae

scale this recipe to make amount of stew you want to eat. I make this in a big pot, i do not make single serving korean style.

some people add and fry a few  shitake mushrooms at the start.i have not tried.

Ingredients:
- 1 onion
- 4-6 cloves of garlic 
- 2 tbsp gochugaru (red pepper flakes, NOT red pepper powder. Will be rough and flakey) Link: https://www.hmart.com/coarse-red-pepper-powder-for-kimchi-1lb-450g-/p
- 2 tbsp gochujang (korean red pepper paste) Link: https://www.hmart.com/sunchang-gochujang-brown-rice-hot-pepper-paste-1-1lb--500g-/p
- Optional - 2 tbsp of doubanjiang 
- 4 cups of kimchi + juice amount is flexible, err on side of more kimchi. The more sour and fermented your kimchi the better!!!!
- 2 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1/4 cup sherry (or rice wine)
- 4 scallions (separate greens and whites, chop all)
- 4-5 yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 quarts vegetable stock, or mnake this: https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/chaeso-gukmul
- 2 zucchinis 
- 1 package of soft tofu (if not korean style in tube then can dice a bit)
- Optional - enoki mushrooms

Directions:
1. heat pot to medium, add sesame oil, cook onions, scallion whites, garlic. Saute until soft
2. add gochugaru and gochujang, stir and fry for a minute or two. careful not to burn it. 
3. Add kimchi (and juice), soy sauce, zucchini, and potatoes. saute, stir, and deglaze a little
4. add stock (change amount to just cover ingredients and be good volume), bring to simmer.
5. simmer for 30 minutes, add soft tofu
6. Simmer for ten more minutes (add enoki mushrooms probably halfway through this)
7. Crush potatoes with wooden spoon. If they are cooked they will be soft and crush easily. If cooked, taste stew and can adjust flavor.
8. When flavored how like, remove from heat and add scallion greens as garnish

you're done !
