# Original recipe from Love & Lemons Simple Feel Good Food's 
# Tofu & Vegetable Green Curry, but I altered the green curry paste considerably

# Ingredients for Green Curry Paste--2 batches, for 6 servings per batch, for Mom spice level
* Dad enjoyed using extra paste to put directly into the bowl at serving time; he thinks he would use 50% more curry paste for his heat and spice level.
* Paste can be made ahead and frozen in ice cube tray or put in fridge for several days.

* 2 tbsp chives, fresh or dried
* 2 tbsp lemongrass, fresh or dried
