# Porcini Mushroom souffle adapted from Jacques Pepin
Makes 2 ramekins worth

# Ingredients (amounts are approximate)
* high heat oil
* 40g-60g dried porcini mushrooms
* sprinkle of salt
* 1/2 tbsp dried or fresh shallots, minced
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* pinch ground nutmeg 
* 1 tbsp butter, salted
* 1 1/2 - 2 tbsp flour
* 3 - 4 tbsp heavy cream; may substitute light cream, half-and-half, and milk in a pinch
* 1/4 cup Parmesan-Regianno cheese, grated
* 1 egg large, lightly beaten 
* spray cooking oil

# Kitchen Items Good to Have
* small Le Creuset skillet
* 2 cup or bigger glass measuring cup
* small spatula or wooden spoon
* 2 ramekins
* tray or oven-safe plate for ramekins to sit on

# Instructions
*  1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees
*  2. Reconstitute the porcini mushrooms: soak in hot water for 20-30 minutes, then strain through small mesh handheld colander or moistened paper towel. Reserve the liquid for another use (it freezes well). Chop the mushrooms.
*  3. Add oil to the skillet, then using medium heat add the porcini mushrooms, a generous sprinkling of salt, shallots, thyme, and nutmeg and stirfry for 3-5 minutes, stirring often.
*  4. When mushrooms hasve stopped reducing and ingredients are mixed and fragrant, add the salted butter. 
*  5. Once the butter has melted, make a roux by stirring in the flour in 3-4 aliquots, stirring in between aliquots. You know you have added sufficient flour when all of the liquid is incorporated and you have a medium thick paste. Stir continuously for 3 minutes.
*  6. Gradually pour in the heavy cream, stirring constantly. Then stir often and cook for 3 minutes.
*  7. Turn off the stove burner heat.
*  8. Stir in the cheese until it melts completely. Taste and adjust salt if needed. 
*  9. Remove from heat and pour conetnts into glass measuring cup. (If you are using a thin skillet, you may not have to transfer it from the skillet.) Stir once in a while for 10 minutes until cooled sufficiently to add eggs without inadvertently cooking them.
* 10. Add the egg and vigorously stir with spatula until completely incorporated.
* 11. Spray the ramekins with cooking spray oil, and place them on tray or oven-safe plate. Pour the mixture into the ramekins up to the top. 
* 12. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until a chopstick comes out clean when inserted into it/egg is set. The top should be golden brown.
* 13. Serve promptly. I inverted mine on a plate before serving/eating, but that is not necessary.
