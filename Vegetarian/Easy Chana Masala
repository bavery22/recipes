Lazy chana masala -- does not involve the extra work of like roasting vegetables https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-chana-masala/

Ingredients:
1 Yellow onion
1 tbsp ground cumin
3/4 tsp sea salt
6 cloves garlic (3 tbsp crushed, just eyeball it)
2 tbsp ginger minced  (2 inches)
1/2 cup cilantro
2-3 green chilli (i used serrano)
4-10 thai chili (to taste)
1 tbsp ground coriander
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 28 oz can of tomatoes, puree or crushed. I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes like we do for jambalaya
2 15 oz cans of chickpeas
1 tsp garam masala
2-3 tsp coconut sugar (sugar in general, i used like 1 tsp)
2 tbsp lemon juice (optional, taste your chana masala and decide0


In a pot heat oil, add cumin, 1/4 tsp salt, and diced onion
cook until caramelized (can stop earlier just more flavor)

Either: grind up the garlic, ginger, cilantro,  and chili peppers and add to the pot 
OR
add garlic, ginger, cilantro, chili peppers, and the onion mixture to a food processor to blitz into a paste

add back to pot, add coriander, chili powder, turmeric, stir to mix
add a little oil here if looking dry

next, add 1/2 tsp of salt, tomatoes, and chickpeas to pot. Can also add a little water if looks to thick. I would probably do 1/4-1/2 a cup of water

bring to a boil, then simmer for 15-20 minutes

after that timeframe and it is more stew like add more salt, chili powder, and can add coconut sugar at this point if want (a little goes a long way)

remove from heat, add garam masala. Also add lemon juice to taste. 

youre done!
