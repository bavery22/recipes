One whole Fish (white fish. tilapia, sea bass, grouper, perch, catfish, flounder. just a fresh white fish. The fresher the fish the better this will taste)
like 3-4 scallions, julienned
like 3-4 inches of garlic, julienned
some cilantro
~.5 tsp sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce (light/seasoned)
optional like .5-1 tbsp of sherry
pinch of ground white pepper
little bit ofsalt if u want but i dont think you need it
few tbsp cooking oil

Fish should be cleaned, descaled, fins clipped. Want head + tail for good luck. head very tasty.
bring water to a boil in wok/pot. steamer rack should fit in it, as well as a plate with the fish.

Stuff about 1/3-1/2 of the ginger into the cavity of the fish. Scatter 1/3 around fish. Fish should be on heat proof plate.

Score the fish, 3 diagonal slashes on side of fish which is pointing up

Place plate on steaming rack -- cover with lid and steam for like 8-10 minutes. Measure with thermometer, 145, to make sure it's cooked.

take out with gloves. Try to remove the liquid that has showed up on the plate (do not pour your fish into the sink)

heat up some oil (a few tbsp) in a sauce pan when hot can add some scallions and ginger here but optional and shouldnt be a lot 
get oil hot
add in the soy sauce, white pepper, sugar, sherry if using, salt if using and stir into mixture

pour mixture over fish and enjoy!
