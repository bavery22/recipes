You can do this with different colors of curry and proteins, but all of these store bought pastes are not mom friendly so

3 shallots
2 lb of some sort of protein, i prefer chicken fish cut into bite sized pieces.
4-8 thai bird peppers ( spice to taste)
3~tbsp thai red curry paste
can of coconut milk
3-5 cloves, 2-3 spoonfuls of garlic
however many potatoes, bell peppers, whatever veggies you want
1 lime
1 bunch cilantro
2 tbsp fish sauce
sugar to taste

add oil to pot on medium low
fry curry paste
add garlic and shallots
stir
If using chicken: add and brown here.
add vegies + coconut milk + top off with water 
bring to boill, turn to simmer.
If chicken simmer for like probably 20-30 minutes
if fish like 15-20 minutes, 
add fish and boil for like 5-10 until soft and tender

stir in cilantro and lime juice
congrats youre done
