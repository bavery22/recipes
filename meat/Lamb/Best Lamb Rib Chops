* Adapted from Lucky Noodles at All Recipes

## Ingredients
* 8 lamb loin chops OR 8 lamp rib chops (approx 1.5 lbs)
* 2 tbsp olive oil, more if needed

# Instructions
* 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees convection roast
* 2. Cut away very excess fat from chops, leaving some on for flavor. 
* 3. Pat chops dry, then brush with olive oil. Rub rosemary on each side. Top with shallots.
* 4. Place in ovenproof heavy skillet such as LeCreuset (Blue round skillet). 
* 5. Start checking temperature with instant-read thermometer: rib chops after 8 minutes, loin chops after 15 minutes.
* 6. 140 degress is medium well. 
* 7. For loin chops, it takes 20-25 minutes before it reads 140. Then flip over and cook for another 5 minutes.
* 8. Remove from oven, and cover tightly with foil. Rest for 8-10 minutes, then serve.
