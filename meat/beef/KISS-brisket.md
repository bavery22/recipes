# KISS Texas Traeger Brisket

## Ingredients
* 1 trimmed brisket flat, about 6 pounds, preferably center-cut, with a cap of fat at least 1/4 inch thick.  Trimming it means to try to make sure that the very hard white fat is no more than 1/4 in thick anywhere. It doesnt melt if it is mush thicker and isnt tasty. This is definitely a best effort kind of thing.
### For rub:
* 3 tbsp coarse kosher salt
* 3 tbsp freshly ground black pepper, preferably medium grind
* 2 tbsp Penzeyâ€™s Chili 9000 powder
* 2 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp onion powder
 
### For mop sauce:
 
* 2 cups beer, preferably Hitachino Next Sweet Stout (can be purchased at Uwajimaya). Alternatives are barleywine or sweet stout.
* 1/4 cup melted butter
* 2 tbsp fish sauce (alternatively, can use Worcestershire sauce + 1 1/2 tsp salt)
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp hot red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tsp onion powder


## Actions
* Make the rub: combine salt, pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika and onion powder together. Season brisket on both sides generously.
* Make the mop: combine all the ingredients in a non-aluminum pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to simmer and stir until salt dissolves. Then decrease to minimum heat to keep butter liquified.
* Start the Traeger on smoke setting with lid open until fire established (about 4-5 minutes). Then close lid and increase heat to 225F until preheated (about 10 minutes).
* Put a wire cooling rack on a rimmed baking sheet.  Place brisket fat side up on rack. Then put in Traeger.
* After the first hour, brush mop sauce on every hour. If mopping directly from the pot, make sure to bring mop sauce back to a boil and then decrease again to a low simmer. Mop for a total of 4 times.
* Optional: leftover mop sauce can be brought to a boil, then turn off and place in the refrigerator. This is to store any leftover brisket.
* When the internal temperature reaches 155, remove brisket from Traeger.
* Wrap tightly in 4 layers of aluminum foil, then place back on rack and place back in Traeger. Starting in approximately 2 hours, check the temperature intermittently by piercing the foil with a meat thermometer (do not unwrap!). Cook until internal temperature reaches 190 (this may take 6-8 hours).
* Remove from Traeger, leaving brisket wrapped in foil. Allow 1-2 hours to come to room temperature.
** this is really impt. the brisket is much more tender if you let it cool til you can easily handle it for cutting.
* Carefully unwrap the Traeger (preferably over a pan so the juices can be reserved).
* Thinly slice across the grain. Pour the juices on top. 
* Optional: before storing leftovers, pour mop sauce over it.
