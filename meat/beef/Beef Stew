This is adapated from dad's beef daub recipe

big note: this is a stew recipe. It is forgiving in measurements. adjust as you'd like, i default to going over vs going under though
other big note: make this in a dutch oven or something similar. you are putting the whole pot in the oven.

Main Ingredients:
-3 lb of beef shank or chuck roast -- if shank do bone in and increase amount of meat. dont use pre bought stew meat -- is trash
-8 to 10 shallots Or 2~ onions chopped
-kosher salt
-freshly ground black pepper (pre ground is trash)
-2 tbsp tomato paste
-3-4 cloves of garlic
-2 cups of hearty red wine (dad and I like saint cosme cotes du rhone, rhone wines in general probably a safe bet) 
  -saint cosme cotes du rhone link for context: https://www.vinerepublic.com/products/14296316/chateau-de-saint-cosme-cotes-du-rhone-2023
-1 14.5 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (I wonder if fire roasted crushed would be good?)
-1 LB of carrots
-2 tsp herbs de provence
-3 bay leaves
-5-6 potatoes (yukon gold yumyum), probably about 1-2 lbs. dice and leave skin on 
-1 quart of beef stock

optional ingredients:
-few slices of bacon to fry the meat and vegetables in
-2 tbsp brandy, such as cognac. can sub sherry or rice wine
-1/4 cup chopped parsley
-can sub herbs de provence with:
  -1 tsp oregano
  -1 tsp thyme
  -1 tsp sweet basil
  -1 sprig fresh rosemary

Directions:
1. preheat oven to 325 fahrenheit, leave rack on lower part of oven.
2.Cook bacon in your pot, remove when cooked leave bacon grease in pot.
3.While cooking bacon Chop your meat up into 1 inch~1.5 inch cubes
  a. Season both sides with salt and pepper
3.once bacon is cooked, remove it. Start browning your stew meat in single layer batches. 
  a. Browning will take ~10 minutes PER batch if you do it right. All sides should be a rich brown. If you do this right it will taste better.
  b. can brown for less time and it will work just not as tasty
  c. Transfer to a large tray or pan (something that has sides). your meat will excude juices over time and you want to be able to pour it back into your stew
4. Once all meat is cooked, remove all but 1 tbsp of drippings. turn to medium high heat, add shallots/onions and a little salt and pepper (large pinch + several grinds)
5. Once onions/shallots softened, can add optional brandy/sherry. wait 1 minute for it to cook off.
6. Add tomato paste, garlic, herbs de provence(or the substitute). Stir and saute for 1 minute
7. Add wine and bring to boil. Your pot will deglaze (i.e., use your wooden spoon to loosen all the good bits on the bottom of your pot. 
8. Once boiling, pour ONLY the tomato liquid into pot. Then start crushing and adding the tomatoes.
9. Add back your meat, your bacon (broken into bits), bay leaves, your carrots, your potatoes, and beef stock. Stck should be used to top off to a nice height so ingredients are submerged adjust amount accordingly.
10. Bring pot to simmer, then put in oven with lid on. 
11. Stir stew every 45 minutes, window for readiness is 2-3hrs. It is done when it is fork tender (can taste and see)
12. Can garnish with parsley at end if you want (i don't usually), add salt and pepper to taste. congrats youre done! eat with japanese sweet potatoes, parsnip puree, or bread.
