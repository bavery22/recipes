# Prime rib aka rib roast aka standing rib roast

Time: ~1 hour for rib sit outside of fridge (porcini mushrooms can soak and be prepped during that time), ~15-20 minutes to season the roast, approximately 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 hours to roast (depending on size and oven), 1/2 hour to rest once roasted before it is ready to serve. 

## Ingredients
* Rib Roast . # people - 1 for number of ribs. # people to ribs for copious leftovers
* Montreal Steak Seasoning
* olive oil or neutral oil (SPRAY oil works great!)
* dried porcini mushrooms ~ 1 oz bag for roasting 4-rib roast (scale according to # of ribs in roast)
* Optional: ~2 cloves of garlic if roasting 4-rib roast (scale according to # of ribs in roast)
  
### Recommended Tools
*cooking/meat thermometer
*aluminum foil
*roasting pan
*roasting rack (the roughly V-shaped one is preferable)
*small sharp knife
*chopstick
*paper towels

## Actions
* Remove roast from the fridge, and set out unwrapped for ~1 hour for a 3-4 rib roast. This allows it to come to/close to room temperature.
* About 30 minutes after the roast has started resting, preheat oven to 275 Degrees. Using convection setting is optional; don't cadjust temperature if using convection.
* Soak the porcini in hot tap water (1 cup water per 1/2 ounce of dried porcini) for 20-30 min. Then drain or remove from water. Chop.
* If using, peel the garlic cloves and cut into slivers.
* After the roast has come to/close to room temp, pat the roast dry with paper towels.
* Use sharp narrow knife to make 1 in deep holes scattered on the meaty side and the sides. Using chopstick, stuff porcinis in holes. If using garlic, stuff some of the holes solely with garlic slivers and make sure the holes with garlic are very far away from each other.
* Spray all surfaces except the bottom of the rib with spray oil. If using non-spray oil, moisten a paper towel with oil and then rub the roast to transfer the oil to the roast. There has to be enough oil for the steak seasoning to stick on the roast, but not so much oil that the seasoning slides off the roast.
* Sprinkle thoroughly with Montreal Seasoning seasoning to coat.
* Cook on at 275 (convection can be used but probasbly doesn't matter) in the oven (for Traeger 250) until internal temp of meat hits 100-105.
* Raise temp to 375. Turn oven light on and keep an eye on the top part of the roast.  If you note top getting too brown, cover top of meat (without removing it from the oven) a little snugly with foil (so overhangs about 1 inch on the sides)
* Cook until internal temp hits 120 for rare (or 125 medium rare, or 130 for medium). Note that that isn't the final temperature of the roast--the temperature will continue to rise 5-10 degrees as it is resting outside of the oven. 
* Take out of oven.
* Tent (ie. cover with a peaked top above the roast) the entire roast with foil.
* Rest for 30 min before removing foil.
* To serve, slice between the ribs, then pare down as you would a steak to prefered serving size.
