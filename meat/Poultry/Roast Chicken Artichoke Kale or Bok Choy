# Instructions
*  1. Cover a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place in Traeger.
*     Heat older Traeger to 375 degrees, newer one to 400. (An oven won't work, as this dish splatters way too much.)
*  2. Score chickens through skin, then sprinkle with salt (and pepper, if using).
*  3. Carefully removed pre-heated pan from the Traeger. 
*     Add ~ 2 tbsp high heat oil, making sure it is about 1/16th inch deep so that 
*     there is no unoiled spot with the tilt of the Traeger.
*  4. Add chicken to pan and put in Traeger. Set timer for 30 minutes.
*  5. While the chicken is roasting for the 1st 30 minutes, 
*     drain the artichokes, skin the lemons, and cut the lemons into 12 total sections.
*     Chop vegetables. If using, destem the kale, tear in to medium pieces.) Massage with 1-2 tbsp oil to slightly macerate.
*  6. At the end of 25 (newer)/30 (older) minutes, evenly distribute the artichokes and lemons between the chicken.
*     Set timer for 25 (newer)/30 (older) minutes.
*  7. At the end of 25 (newer)/30 (older) minutes, evenly distribute the vegetable between the chickens.
