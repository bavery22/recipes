# Oven-Fried Chicken adapted from Ina Garten

# Prep time: Brining for ~24 hours, and then cooking time approximately 1 1/2 hours

# Ingredients
* 9 chicken thighs, bone-in
* whole fat buttermilk, cultured, 1 pint
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tbsp shallot powder or shallot pepper or pepper
* high heat oil (enough for 1 inch depth to cover half a chicken thigh when frying in heavy-bottomed pot)

# Steps
* 1. Place the 9 chicken thigh in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk over them. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil 
*    or plastic warp and refridgerate for ~24 hours. 
* 2. The following day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees convection.
* 3. Combine the flour, salt, and shallot powder/pepper in a large bowl. 
* 4. With one chicken piece at a time, take out of the buttermilk and coat thoroughly with the flour mixture.
* 5. Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot and heat to 360 degrees using a thermometer.
* 6. Working in batches, place 1-5 chickens (depending on pot size) in hot oil. Do not crowd the pieces.
* 7. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side until the coating is golden brown (it will brown even further in the oven).
* 8. Remove the chicken pieces from the oil and place on a metal baking rack set on a sheet pan.
*    Allow oil heat to return to 360 degrees between frying batches.
* 9. When all of the chicken skin is fried golden, place in oven.
*10. Bake at 350 degrees convection for 15 minutes, then drop temperature if needed to 325 so the skin does not burn.
*11. The chicken is done when the inside is no longer pink (at least 165 degrees), about 30-40 minutes total baking time.
