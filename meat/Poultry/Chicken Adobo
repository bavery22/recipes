stupid easy recipe, also easy to adjust

2 lbs bone in chicken (thighs drumsticks easiest). I use skin on too.
3 bay leaves
4 tbsp soy sauce (if not using filipino soy sauce, probably do like 2-3 light and 1-2 dark soy sauce)
6 tbsp white vinegar
5 cloves garlic
1.5  cups water
2~ tbsp of sherry
1 tsp sugar
salt to taste
1 tsp whole peppercorn

marinate chicken with soy sauce, sherry, and optionally the garlic. 1 hour to overnight

heat pot, add cooking oil
brown chicken in pan 
once browned add rest of marinade + garlic
add water (i just do it by instinct tbh just top it off)
bring to boil -- then add peppercorn + bay leaves (you can add with the marinade doesnt rly matter)
Simmer for 30 minutes -- chicken should be pretty tender
add vinegar, simmer for ten minutes
add sugar and salt to taste, youre done congrats! 

lots of ways to adjust this, can add eggs, sauce is sooo good and this recipe is real easy
