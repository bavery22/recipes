## Actions

### 5-8 quart Le Creuset Dutch Oven
* Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees. 275 for non convection. This is MUCH easier on convection. Non convection check temp very very carefully.
* Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper (this is a very essential step for proper browning).
* Heat fat of choice in large Dutch oven over medium heat until just smoking.
* Add chicken breast-side down; scatter onion, celery, garlic, bay leaf, and rosemary around chicken.
* Cook until breast is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
* Using a wooden spoon inserted into cavity of bird, flip chicken breast-side up and cook until chicken and vegetables are well browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
* Remove Dutch oven from heat; place large sheet of foil over pot and cover tightly with lid.
* Transfer pot to oven and cook until instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when inserted in thickest part of breast and 175 degrees in thickest part of thigh, 90 to 110 minutes. On non convection do not be surprised to wait 120- 150 minutes.

#### Part 2:
* Transfer chicken to carving board, tent with foil, and rest 20 minutes.
* Meanwhile, strain chicken juices from pot through fine-mesh strainer into fat separator, pressing on solids to extract liquid; discard solids (you should have about ¾ cup juices).
* Allow liquid to settle 5 minutes, then pour into saucepan and set over low heat.
* Carve chicken, adding any accumulated juices to saucepan.
* Stir lemon juice into jus to taste. Serve chicken, passing jus at table.
