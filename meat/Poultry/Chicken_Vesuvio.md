## Ingredients

* Approx 1/3 cup olive oil, preferably extra-virgin
* 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano 
* Approx 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* Salt and pepper; may use shallot pepper 
* 8 chicken thighs with bone-in and skin-on, approx. 3 lbs
* 4 tbsp unsalted butter, preferable cut up in several chunks
* 1 large shallot or 2 small shallots, sliced
* 1 1/4 cup chicken stock
* 1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Chateau La Graviere Entre Deus-Mers white bordeaux
* 1 cup frozen green peas
* juice of a lemon
* optional: parsley, chopped to sprinkle over chicken once cooked

## Instructions

* FYI Brown the chicken on the stovetop while the potatoes are baking.

*  1: Heat oven to 425 degrees convection.
*  2: In 13" x 9" baking dish or roasting pan with tall sides, toss potatoes with the oregano and a little over half the olive oil. 
*  3: Potatoes can be seasoned with salt and pepper. Spread in a mostly even layer. 
*  4: Bake for 15 minutes, then gently toss and bake for another ~15 minutes.
*  5: Remove from oven when the edges begin to brown, and are still firm yet can be pierced with a fork.
*  6: While potatoes are baking, season chicken with thyme, salt and pepper/shallot pepper.
*  7: Heat 12" large skillet with rest of olive oil over medium-high until oil shimmers.
*  8: Working in batches if needed, cook chicken skin side down until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.
*  9: Transfer chicken to a rimmed plate or shallow bowl, leaving behind the drippings.
* 10: Reduce skillet heat to medium-low, and add all of the butter and shallots. Cook until shallots start to brown.
* 11: Add stock, wine, and 1/2 of lemon juice to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. 
* 12: Remove from heat and mix in the peas. Pour over the potatoes and stir gently to combine.
* 13: Place chicken on top of the potato mixture, skin side up. If there is any chicken juice in the bowl, drizzle on top of the chicken.
* 14: Place roasting pan back in oven and bake. Start checking temperature at 20 minutes; chicken is cooked is when it reaches 165 degrees.
* 15: Drizzle chicken with remaining lemon juice. May sprinkle wtih parsley.
