# Char Siu (chinese bbq) CORRECTED 12 26, 2023!


## Ingredients
*  3 pounds (1.4 kg) boneless pork shoulder/pork butt (select a piece with some good fat on it) OR 3 lbs pork tenderloin (a leaner cut, and less work to prep)
*  1/2 cup granulated white (pr cane) sugar
*  1/2 cup dark brown sugar
*  1/4 cup salt
*  1 tbs Chinese five spice powder
*  1 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
*  1 tbs toasted sesame oil
*  ~1/3 cup (or 6 tbsp) Chinese rose wine (Shaoxing rice wine is a good substitute)
** I personally use Lustau East India Solera Sherry
** do NOT use the salt infused chinese pseudo wines at the grocery store.
*  ~1/3 cup (or 6 tbsp) double black soy sauce (dark is preferred, but regular is fine)
*  ~1/3 cup (or 6 tbsp) hoisin sauce
*  1.5 tbs Barley Malt Syrup (I use Eden brand)
** can substitute unsulphured molasses but do NOT use blackstrap. its too bitter.
*  3~1/3 cup (or 6 tbsp) of red miso (optional)
*  4 tablespoons dried Penzey's garlic soaked in hot water just enough to make soft or 6 cloves finely minced garlic
*  4 tbsp barley malt or honey (for the basting sauce)
** if you have chinese maltose aka be ge ga you can use it
*  3 tbsp (approximate amount) hot water to make the basting sauce if using honey
*  
*  You will need also need a metal rack, aluminum foil, and a metal tray with some depth (because water will get poured into it) that the rack will sit in.
*  You will have 2 sauces--the marinade for the pork, and the basting sauce. The marinade serves two purposes; first it is used to marinade the pork, and then it is heated thoroughly and used later as a dipping/topping sauce. 




## Actions

* If using pork shoulder or pork butt, cut the pork into long strips or chunks about 3 inches thick. Don’t trim any excess fat, as it will render off and add flavor.
* If using pork tenderloin, you can choose to cut off the white membrane, also split them in 1/2 lengthwise.
*  Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, fermented miso (optional) , and garlic(softened in hot water if penzeys) in a bowl to make the marinade.
*  Reserve about 3/4-1 cup of marinade and set it aside in the fridge overnight. 
*  Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours.
*  Preheat your oven to setting 475 degrees convection roast with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven.
** if you have a sliding rack use it since it is much easier to slide out the food and baste/flip it than to carry it around
*  Line the metal pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Using the metal rack keeps the pork off of the pan and allows it to roast more evenly, like it does in commercial ovens described above. 
*  Place the pork on the rack (Save the marinade it has been sitting in), leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour at least 2 cups water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking. Transfer the pork to your preheated oven. More water is fine. too little is bad.
*  Heat the used marinade on the stove and allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Then strain it, and transfer it back to the fridge. This will be the dipping/topping sauce. 
*  Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the barley malt, maltose, or honey (maltose is very viscous––you can heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and approximately 3 tablespoons hot water to dilute the marinade enough it can be used to brush on the pork. This is the basting sauce you’ll use for basting the pork.
*  Using a pastry brush, paint the pork and then flip it at regular intervals per the table below. Note that after the first 25 minutes, the temp of the oven is decreased.
*  After another 15 minutes, the pork has cooked for 40 minutes total. It should be cooked through and caramelized on top. If it’s not caramelized to your liking, you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the outside and add some color/flavor. Be sure not to walk away during this process, since the sweet char siu BBQ sauce can burn if left unattended.
*  Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing, and enjoy!
* If not burned, you can pour the drippings that landed in the water over the meat. If the drippings are too runny, reduce them in a pan and pour that over.
