# Char Siu (chinese bbq) CORRECTED Sept 26, 2022!


## Ingredients
*  3 pounds (1.4 kg) boneless pork shoulder/pork butt (select a piece with some good fat on it) OR 3 lbs pork tenderloin
*  1 cup granulated white sugar (50g) (or use equivalent of1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar)
*  1/4 cup salt
*  1 tablespoon Chinese five spice powder
*  1 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
*  1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
*  2 tablespoon Chinese rose wine (Shaoxing rice wine is a good substitute)
** I personally use Lustau East India Solera
*  1 tablespoon soy sauce (dark is preferred, but regular is fine)
*  1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
*  2 teaspoons molasses (or 1.5 tsp brown sugar + 1 tsp water)
*  1 tablespoon – roughly 2 cubes – of red fermented bean curd
*  3 cloves finely minced garlic
*  2 tablespoons maltose or honey
*  1 tablespoon hot water




## Actions

* Cut the pork into long strips or chunks about 3 inches thick. Don’t trim any excess fat, as it will render off and add flavor.
*  Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, fermented bean curd, and garlic in a bowl to make the marinade (i.e. the BBQ sauce).
*  Reserve about 1/2 cup  of marinade and set it aside. Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.
*  Preheat your oven to the highest setting (475-550 degrees F or 250-290 degrees C) with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven. [Do NOT put Miele oven at highest setting, use convection roast setting.]
*  Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Using the metal rack keeps the pork off of the pan and allows it to roast more evenly, like it does in commercial ovens described above. Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour 2 cups water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
*  Transfer the pork to your preheated oven and follow the table.
*  Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the maltose or honey (maltose is very viscous––you can heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and 1 tablespoon hot water. This will be the sauce you’ll use for basting the pork.
*  By now, the pork has cooked for 40 minutes total. It should be cooked through and caramelized on top. If it’s not caramelized to your liking, you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the outside and add some color/flavor. Be sure not to walk away during this process, since the sweet char siu BBQ sauce can burn if left unattended.
*  Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing, and enjoy!
* If not burned, you can pour the drippings over the meat . If the drippings are too runny, reduce them in a pan and pour that over.
