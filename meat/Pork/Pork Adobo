2 lb pork belly cut into cubes (i usually do about 1 inch cubes)
5 cloves garlic ( i use a few spoons of pre minced / crushed garlic)
5 bay leaves
4 tbsp vinegar
1/2 cup soy sauce (use filipino soy sauce, if not using then use mix of light and dark)
1 tbsp peppercorn
2 cups water
salt/sugar to taste (like 1 tsp max of sugar)
few tbsp of sherry (optional)
1 tbsp of oyster sauce (optional)

marinate pork belly for about an hour with soy sauce, garlic, and then optional sherry and oyster sauce. I have more luck when i do not marinate this over night.
Marinate in separate bowl so that you can take out and brown the pork belly in pot.

brown pork belly.
Add rest of marinade 
add peppercorn + bay leaves, top off with water bring to a boil
simmer for 40 minutes -> 1 hour 
add vinegar and simme for 10-15 more minutes
salt/sugar to taste
