# Hoison Ground Pork and Bok Choy

## Ingredients
* 1 lb ground pork
* sliced ginger ~ 4 in
* Bok Choy ~ 2 lbs chopped
* Shallots 2-3 sliced
* 2 tbsp guilin sauce
* 3 tbsp sherry
* 1/4 cup hoison sauce
* 2 tbsp thin/light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 3 tbsp ginger syrup


## Actions
* Saute shallots and ginger until shallots are soft
* Add pork. Cook until pork has browned.
* Drain fat. I usually do this by dumping it all into a metal colander then putting it back in the pot.
* Add sauces.  Cook until sauces start to bubble.
* Gradually add bok choy. I tend to add it in ~3 steps; letting it cook down each time. This gives bok choy of diff levels of crunchiness.  this may just be a brian preference.
* serve over rice or udon noodles.
