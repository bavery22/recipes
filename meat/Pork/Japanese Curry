ingredients:
1 bay leaf
2-3 lbs of pork (loin chop, or pork tenderloin. This can also be bonelses skinless chicken thighs)
1-2 tbsp ginger syrup
1-2 tbsp honey
1/2 of a grated fuji apple
1 onion
.5-1 cup of red wine or nitro beer
4 cups dashi stock (use chicken stock if using chicken as meat)
2-3 cloves garlic
Curry roux (two types, I like java + golden curry)
tbsp of soy sauce or someth

those are rough measurements just measure with your gut 

steps:
dice onions and garlic set aside
peel and chop carrots + potatoes, set aside with the grated apple
cut meat into bite sized pieces 

fry onions + garlic (im told caramelizing onions makes taste good but lots of work)
add meat and brown
add everything except the curry roux 

bring to a boil and simmer for 30-40 minutes until potatoes are soft (press with wooden spoon against side of pot, see if falls apart easily), stir like every ten minutes

turn off heat, remove from heat
Explanation of curry roux:
each package comes with two large squares of separately packaged curry blocks
add half of the large square package from each type of curry to the pot 

Stir that in until mostly incorporated

turn heat back on, simmer for like 5 minutes while stirring then remove from heat and enjoy

this will taste better the next day :)
