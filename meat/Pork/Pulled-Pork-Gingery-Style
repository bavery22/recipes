    1 tbsp Ground Ginger
    scant Chili 9000 powder
    spray olive oil or ~ 3 tbsp olive oil
    1 tbsp high heat oil
    4 pounds bone-in pork shoulder, cut in half 
    4-5 shallots sliced

    2 bottles Hitachino Next Sweet Stout (can be purchased at Uwajimaya), for total of 22 ounces

**Actions**

    Preheat oven to 280 degree roast convection.
    Combine salt, Chinese 5 Spice, ground ginger and chili powder in shallow bowl and mix.
    Rub (or spray) olive oil over pork,
    Put in bowl. Sprinkle rub over meat, toss meat with 2 big spoons, sprinkle rub over meat, repeat until rub applied evenly and is all gone. 
    Toss periodically while letting pork sit at room temp for 30 min.
    Using large Dutch oven heat the high heat oil. When hot, add one half of the pork. 
    Brown on all sides (3-4 minutes each half). Do not allow seasonings to blacken or pork to get black. 
    Transfer seared pork to plate, then repeat with second half.
    Turn down heat to medium, add shallots, sauté and loosen brownings until shallots are translucent and slightly caramelized (about 2-6 minutes).
    Add vinegar and Japanese beer (warning—will froth quite a bit). Loosen remaining brownings.
    Add the white miso and terikayi/Hoisin sauce.
    Mix well
    Add the meat back in.
    Cover. Place in oven.
    Cook for 3 3/4 hours until fork tender.
    Transfer pork to large bowl, it should fall apart. Can use a fork to gently pull apart further.
    Separate drippings and discard fat.
    Add braising liquid back to the pork.

Optional:

    If you dont have the Hitachino Next Sweet Stout, you can use deschutes black butte porter and 1 tbs of ginger syrup.
