Ingredients:
=1 lb Glutinous Rice Flour (Mochiko)
-one 13.5-14 Oz Can of full fat coconut milk
-1.5 cups of whole milk at room temp
-1 and 2/3rds cups of sugar (whatever's fine, I just use white caking sugar)
-1 stick of unsalted butter (1/2 cup)
-3 eggs at room temp
-1 tbsp baking powder
-1 tsp vanilla extract
-3/4 cups / 90 grams unsweetened shredded coconut

1. Set oven to 350 degrees on bake, 325 convection bake if at hartford place
2. Whisk everything except for the coconut in a bowl until smooth
3. mix in the coconut and let sit for 15 minutes
4. butter or oil up a 9x13 glass baking pan (i usually use unsalted butter)
5. bake for 1 hour and 10 -> 1 hour and 20 minutes, rotating halfway through if your oven sucks 

to tell if done: top should be golden, can insert a chopstick to see if the butter mochi sticks to it
but u can always take out eat and rebake for a few minutes
