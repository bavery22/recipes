# Ingredients
1 cup sugar, preferably caster or demerara
2 large eggs
1/2 cup molasses or treacle
1/2 cup solid shortening, melted and then cooled to room temperature
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 1/2 cups white wheat flour (or 1/2 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup white flour)
1 tbsp cocoa powder
2 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp whole cloves, freshly ground
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg, freshly ground
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt

#Instructions
1. If not already done, microwave shortening, then add the coconut oil and allow to come to room temp.
(If this is not done, then the cookies are lumpier but still tasty--just need to bake longer)
2. Preheat oven to 300 degrees convection if using Miele, otherwise set to 325. Place parchment paper on 2 baking sheets (or bake serially).
3. Mix sugar and eggs together using a whisk attachment until light yellow in color.
4. In the meantime, in a separate medium size bowl mix together flour(s), cocoa, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, nutmet, baking soda, and salt.
5. To the sugar/egg mixture, mix in the molasses/treacle and then liquid shortening.
6. Changing to a paddle attachment on the mixer, gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.
7. For 8-9 gigantic cookies total, use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop out dough onto parchment paper, then flatten slightly to 2' diameter & 3-4 inches apart.
For ~16 merely large cookies, use a 2 tbsp spoon to scoop dough onto parchment paper.
8. Bake 12-14 minutes for the gigantic cookies and 10-12 minutes until cookies smell done.
9. Move parchment paper to a rack and let rest for a few minutes, then transfer cookies directly onto rack to finish cooling.
